# NotJustAGrid - SASS

I really like [notjustagrid](http://notjustagrid.com) but I use SASS in
my projects. I converted the CSS files to SASS/SCSS so I wouldn't have
to do it again.

## Installation

The original-style SASS files are located in css/sass and
the new-style SASS files are in css/scss. To add this to a Rails app,
just copy either style of SASS files to public/stylesheets/sass in your
application. Also, make sure you have the [HAML](https://github.com/nex3/haml)
gem or [SASS](https://github.com/nex3/sass) gem in your Gemfile.

## Enjoy!
